		# sensitive parameters
		Your team is asked to handle the issue that terraform code outputs the password of the database after you issue
		the `terraform apply`. How would you achieve the safety of the passwords?

		1. [ ] Encrypt the plain text values to show output as random values
		1. [ ] Password is encrypted in the database
		1. [x] Use sensitive Parameter
		> Make use of a delicate parameter. By running the terraform apply
		and plan command on the console, the value is not displayed. The
		password for the state files can be seen in plain-text format if you
		have access.
		1. [ ] Use terraform plan -var-file= “password=no” to hide output values


		> https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/sensitive-data.html

		# Update existing AWS resources
		You need to change the instance type of an EC2 instance to `t3.large` while
		keeping the default set values.
		What adjustments do you make in order to meet his goal?

		1. [ ] Issue Terraform plan instance.type ` .t2.large ` and it deploys the
		instance
		> Correct since the syntax is incorrect. To alter the
		instance type, use the cli command `terraform plan -
		var="instancetype=t2.large"` which is referred to as `Instance.type`
		in the above option. The instance is not deployed using t2.large or
		terraform plan.

		1. [ ] Modify the `tf.variables` with the instance type and issue terraform
		apply
		> Incorrect because it is recommended that instead of
		modifying the default values, you modify the `terraform.tfvars`
		variables, as there are no `tf.variables` in terraform. Terraform plan to
		check the instance type and then terraform apply for changes
		because it is always a good practise to check before applying.

		1. [ ] Create a new file `my.tfvars` and add the type of the instance and
		issue `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`
		> Incorrect because the suggested file type for Terraform is
		`terraform.tfvars`. To use cli terraform plan -var-file="my.tfvars" for any
		other tf.vars file types, use cli terraform plan -var-file="my.tfvars"

		1. [x] Modify the `terraform.tfvars` with the instance type and issue
		`terraform plan` and then terraform apply to deploy the instances
		> Correct, since it checks the values after altering the
		terraform.tfvars and then issues terraform apply.

		# basics, workspace
		One of your colleagues is new to Terraform and wants to add a new
		workspace named new-hire. What command he should execute from
		the following?

		1. [ ] terraform workspace –new –new-hire
		1. [x] terraform workspace new new-hire
		> The syntax to use anytime you wish to create a new
		workspace is terraform workspace new new-hire.
		New-hire terraform workspace, for example
		New workspace "new-hire" has been created and switched to!
		1. [ ] terraform workspace init new-hire
		1. [ ] terraform workspace new-hire

		# basics, supported operation system
		You're preparing to install Terraform on client workstations and want
		to see which of the  following operating systems is supported?
		Please select the
		appropriate option.

		1. [ ] Windows
		1. [ ] Amazon Linux
		1. [ ] FreeBSD
		1. [ ] Solaris
		1. [ ] MacOS
		1. [x] All of the above

		> All of the above are correct. Amazon Linux is just another flavor of Linux. Terraform works
		perfectly well on it.
		Please find the URL for your reference https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html

		#
		John is a newbie to Terraform and wants to enable detailed logging
		to find all the details
		Which environment variable does he need to set?

		1. [ ] TF_help
		1. [x] TF_LOG
		1. [ ] TF_Debug
		1. [ ] TF_var_log

		> Terraform does not give detailed logging by default. The environment
		variable TF LOG must be enabled to allow thorough logging.
		You can set the TRACE, INFO, WARN, or ERROR, DEBUG levels
		by enabling TF LOG.
		https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/config/environment-variables.html


		You have made changes to your tfvar files and would like to know
		the contents of the state file. What command can be used for the
		given requirement?

		1. [ ] terraform state
		1. [ ] terraform current
		1. [x] terraform show
		1. [ ] terraform inspect

		> The terraform show command displays comprehensible output from
		state or plain files.
		This is used to double-check the current state contents and inspect
		the plan to ensure that everything is in working order (right).
		Terraform show – json can be used to display outputs in json format.
		https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/commands/show.htmL

		# Your firm employs a version control system (for example, git) and
		has requested that you commit all terraform code to it. During the
		commit, you must be cautious with sensitive information. Which of
		the following files should be left out of the commit?

		1. [ ] main.tf
		1. [ ] variables.tf
		1. [ ] provisioner.tf
		1. [x] terraform.tfstate (right)

		>  Usually, terraform.tfvars and terraform.tfstate files contain sensitive
		data like passwords, access keys, and DB passwords. It is best to
		avoid these files from committing

		#  Your company's infrastructure is now hosted on Azure, and you
		intend to use Terraform for further development and migration of
		existing resources to Terraform. You've been tasked with planning
		and implementing it, as well as ensuring that the old infrastructure is
		correctly moved.
		You attempted to utilise the terraform import command but were
		unable to do so. What are the things that must be considered when
		importing?

		1. [ ] Ensure the existing resources are in a shutdown state so that
		during import there are no issues.
		1. [x] Ensure the resources of the existing infrastructure are updated in
		the configuration file.
		1. [ ] Add all the resource details to state files.
		1. [ ] Run terraform show and refresh to see updated state files and
		then terraform import.

		> Terraform can import a resource into a state file, but not into a
		configuration file. Before terraform import, it's a good idea to
		manually add resource configuration.
		https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/import/index.html

		# Choose the best option from below to make Terraform code more
		user configuration-centric.

		1. [ ] Variables
		1. [ ] Local values
		1. [x] Input Variable
		1. [ ] Modules

		> Input variables are used as parameters in Terraform modules,
		allowing them to be customised without modifying the module's
		source code and allowing modules to be shared across
		configurations.
		You can set the values of variables declared in the root module of
		your configuration using CLI options and environment variables. The
		calling module should pass values to the module block when
		declaring them in child modules.
		Comparing Terraform modules to function definitions can be useful if
		you're familiar with traditional programming languages:
		Function arguments are analogous to input variables.
		Function return values are analogous to output values.
		Local values are similar to the temporary local variables in a
		function.

		Reference:
		https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/variables.html

		# Which of the following is a meta-argument defined in the
		configuration files of Terraform?

		1. [ ] tfvar
		1. [x] depends_on
		1. [ ] instance_aws
		1. [ ] var1

		>   depends_on is the meta-argument defined in the configuration files
		of Terraform.
		https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/metaarguments/
		depends_on.html
		Option A is incorrect: tfvars refers to the file extension rather than a
		meta-argument for configurations within the files.
		Option C is incorrect: instance aws is the resource type that
		Terraform uses to create VMs in AWS. It's an AWS predefined
		resource type, not a file-based configuration.
		Option D is incorrect: var1 is a word used to define a variable, not a
		meta-argument, so it is incorrect.

		#  Your configuration file has been locked accidentally. What of the
		following command would you use to unlock?

		1. [ ] terraform filename-unlock
		1. [ ] delete the file and create a new state file
		1. [x] terraform force-unlock
		1. [ ] state.tf -unlock

		>   The terraform force-unlock command can be used to unlock the
		state configuration manually. It has no effect on the infrastructure.
		Refer to the following link for Syntax
		https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/commands/force-unlock.html
