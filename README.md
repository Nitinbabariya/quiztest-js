# quiztest 

I'm working on this project in my free time to learn more about https://svelte.dev/

- supports markdown text formatting, images, syntax highlighting and math rendering.
- different [quiz-types](./docs/syntax.md): single-choice, multiple-choice, sequence.
- support for [hints and explanations](./docs/syntax.md#hints-and-comments).
- [options](./docs/options.md) for color theme, question shuffling, localization.
- can be easily included in any website, static site generator or [other web projects](./docs/module_import.md).
- mobile friendly with touch support for all question types.

## Usage

quiztest is easy to setup and best used in combination with existing static site generators like *Jekyll*, *Hugo* or *Sphinx*. Check out the extensions
[hugo-quiz](https://github.com/bonartm/hugo-quiz) and [sphinxcontrib-quizdown](https://github.com/bonartm/sphinxcontrib-quizdown).

### ðŸ“š [Documentation](./docs/)

## Stand-alone Example

Add the library to your website and initialize with default options:

```html
<head>
	...
    <script 
	src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quiztest@latest/public/build/quiztest.js">
	</script>
	<script>quiztest.init();</script>
	...
</head>
```

To keep the bundle size low, syntax highlighting and math rendering are implemented in separate extensions that can be loaded and registered manually if needed: 

```html
<head>
	...
    <script src="./build/quiztest.js"></script>
	<script src="./build/extensions/quiztestKatex.js"></script>
	<script src="./build/extensions/quiztestHighlight.js"></script>
	<script>
		quizdown.register(quiztestKatex).register(quiztestHighlight).init();
	</script>
	...
</head>
```

Write questions within a `quiztest` class (edit in the [ðŸš€quizdown editor](https://bonartm.github.io/quizdown-live-editor/?code=---%0AprimaryColor%3A%20steelblue%0AshuffleQuestions%3A%20false%0AshuffleAnswers%3A%20true%0A---%0A%0A%23%23%23%20Select%20your%20superpowers!%0A%0A-%20%5B%20%5D%20Enhanced%20Strength%0A-%20%5B%20%5D%20Levitation%0A-%20%5Bx%5D%20Shapeshifting%0A%0A%23%23%23%20What%27s%20the%20capital%20of%20Germany%3F%0A%0A%3E%20Hint%3A%20The%20_largest_%20city%20in%20Germany...%0A%0A1.%20%5Bx%5D%20Berlin%0A1.%20%5B%20%5D%20Frankfurt%0A1.%20%5B%20%5D%20Paris%0A1.%20%5B%20%5D%20Cologne)):

## Contributing

Pull requests and feature requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. I'm happy for any feedback on how to improve the code base. 

### Wish List
- Add timer that could be turned on or off
- Show question index so its easier for people to jump around the questions, add a flag so its easy to review 
- customizable reward page at the end of the quiz. Nice to show encouraging messages if the user is not performing well or otherway if the user is really good then play some animation and music
- fill in the blanks quiz
- link quizzes on different pages together via a results summary page (https://github.com/bonartm/quizdown-js/issues/18)
