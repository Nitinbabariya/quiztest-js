# quiztest [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/quiztest.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/quiztest) [![Build](https://github.com/Nitinbabariya/quiztest-js/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Nitinbabariya/quiztest-js/actions/workflows/build.yml)

I'm working on this project in my free time to learn more about https://svelte.dev/

- supports markdown text formatting, images, syntax highlighting and math rendering.
- different [quiz-types](./docs/syntax.md): single-choice, multiple-choice, sequence.
- support for [hints and explanations](./docs/syntax.md#hints-and-comments).
- [options](./docs/options.md) for color theme, question shuffling, localization.
- can be easily included in any website, static site generator or [other web projects](./docs/module_import.md).
- mobile friendly with touch support for all question types.

## Usage

quiztest is easy to setup and best used in combination with existing static site generators like *Jekyll*, *Hugo* or *Sphinx*. Check out the extensions
[hugo-quiz](https://github.com/Nitinbabariya/hugo-quiz) 

### ðŸ“š [Documentation](./docs/)

## Stand-alone Example

Add the library to your website and initialize with default options:

```html
<head>
	...
    <script 
	src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quiztest@latest/public/build/quiztest.js">
	</script>
	<script>quiztest.init();</script>
	...
</head>
```

To keep the bundle size low, syntax highlighting and math rendering are implemented in separate extensions that can be loaded and registered manually if needed: 

```html
<head>
	...
    <script src="./build/quiztest.js"></script>
	<script src="./build/extensions/quiztestKatex.js"></script>
	<script src="./build/extensions/quiztestHighlight.js"></script>
	<script>
		quizdown.register(quiztestKatex).register(quiztestHighlight).init();
	</script>
	...
</head>
```

Write questions within a `quiztest` class (edit in the [ðŸš€quizdown editor](https://bonartm.github.io/quizdown-live-editor/?code=---%0AprimaryColor%3A%20steelblue%0AshuffleQuestions%3A%20false%0AshuffleAnswers%3A%20true%0A---%0A%0A%23%23%23%20Select%20your%20superpowers!%0A%0A-%20%5B%20%5D%20Enhanced%20Strength%0A-%20%5B%20%5D%20Levitation%0A-%20%5Bx%5D%20Shapeshifting%0A%0A%23%23%23%20What%27s%20the%20capital%20of%20Germany%3F%0A%0A%3E%20Hint%3A%20The%20_largest_%20city%20in%20Germany...%0A%0A1.%20%5Bx%5D%20Berlin%0A1.%20%5B%20%5D%20Frankfurt%0A1.%20%5B%20%5D%20Paris%0A1.%20%5B%20%5D%20Cologne)):
